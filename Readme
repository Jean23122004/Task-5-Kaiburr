Task 5: Data Science Example - Consumer Complaint Text Classification

1. Project Overview

This project implements a complete pipeline for multi-class text classificatio using the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) complaint database. The objective is to build, compare, and evaluate machine learning models capable of classifying free-form complaint narratives into one of the four required product categories:

| ID | Category |
| :---: | :--- |
| 0 | Credit reporting, repair, or other |
| 1 | Debt collection |
| 2 | Consumer Loan |
| 3 | Mortgage |

The pipeline strictly adheres to the six steps outlined in the assessment.

2. Technical Requirements

Prerequisites
* Python 3.8+
* The following libraries are required: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.


3. Methodology and Model Comparison (Steps 1, 2, 3, & 4)

Step 1 & 2: Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

The text data underwent rigorous cleaning to reduce noise and normalize the vocabulary:
Contraction Handling: Common contractions were expanded.
Cleaning: The text was converted to lowercase, and punctuation/words containing digits were removed.
Tokenization & Filtering Stopwords were removed.
Normalization:Lemmatization was applied to reduce words to their base form.
Feature Engineering: The cleaned text was converted into a numerical format using the TF-IDF Vectorizer.

Step 3 & 4: Model Selection and Comparison

Three robust multi-classification models were trained and compared based on their Accuracy on the 20% test set:

| Model Name | Type | Key Hyperparameters | Initial Accuracy (Example Output) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Linear SVM | Support Vector Machine | `dual=False`, `max_iter=1000` | 0.8871 |
| Logistic Regression| Linear Model | `solver='liblinear'`, `max_iter=1000` | 0.8854 |
| Multinomial Naive Bayes | Probabilistic Classifier | Default settings | 0.8752 |

Conclusion: The Linear SVM model yielded the highest accuracy and was selected as the **`best_model`** for the final evaluation steps.

 4. Model Evaluation and Prediction (Steps 5 & 6)

Step 5: Model Evaluation

The final evaluation was performed on the test set using the best model.

Classification Report (Linear SVM)


The Confusion Matrix visually confirms the model's performance by showing correct and incorrect classifications between the four categories.


Step 6: Prediction

A final prediction was demonstrated on a sample, unseen complaint using the finalized best model.
